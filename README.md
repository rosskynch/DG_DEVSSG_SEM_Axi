Implementation of A Spectral Element DEVSS-G/DG Method for Viscoelastic Flows in Axisymmetric Geometries.
=====================

This code is the result of my PhD research work and contains an implementation of the method described in Kynch, R.M. and Phillips, T.N., 2016. A high resolution spectral element approximation of viscoelastic flows in axisymmetric geometries using a DEVSS-G/DG formulation. *Journal of Non-Newtonian Fluid Mechanics*. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnnfm.2016.12.008
